# WeatherMe

To correctly configure, Ngrok needs to be running and synced with Twilio.
The number used with Twilio can be texted with a city/region name and application will scrape basic weather data from Weather.gov.
Weather data will be sent to origin number.
Kind of useful when you are tired of fancy weather applications or in locations with less than ideal cell service such as...


...The mountains where service is spotty and weather is always changing but a text can usually get through.

...When you get tired of being served ads while just trying to see the tempurature.

...When your phone is old and modern weather applications are unreasonably heavy.

...When you dont need a fancy GUI to know the weather
